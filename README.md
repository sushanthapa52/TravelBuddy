## Usage of Git Features

### Branching

To ensure a smooth development process, we created multiple branches for different features and fixes:

- `main`: The main branch containing the stable version of the application.
- `feature/checklist`: A branch dedicated to developing the checklist feature.
- `feature/ui`: A branch for working on the user interface.

### Merging

Once the features were tested and stable, they were merged back into the `main` branch:

- Merging `feature/checklist` into `main` added the predefined checklists and customization feature.
- Merging `feature/ui` into `main` integrated the user interface improvements.

### Pull Requests

We used pull requests to review and discuss the changes before merging them:

- PR #1: Added the checklist feature.
